A tiny Python package for easy access to up-to-date Coronavirus (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) cases data.

<!-- Python API Wrapper for tracking Coronavirus (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) via https://github.com/ExpDev07/coronavirus-tracker-api -->

## About

COVID19Py is a Python wrapper made to be compatible with [ExpDev07/coronavirus-tracker-api](https://github.com/ExpDev07/coronavirus-tracker-api) REST API.
It retrieves data directly from an instance of [@ExpDev07](https://covid-tracker-us.herokuapp.com/)'s backend but it can also be set up to use a different backend.

To achieve this, just pass the URL of the backend as a parameter to the library's constructor:

```python
import COVID19Py
covid19 = COVID19Py.COVID19("https://my-awesome-covid19-backend")
```

## Installation

In order install this package, simply run:

```bash
pip install COVID19Py
```

## Usage

To use COVID19Py, you first need to import the package and then create a new instance:

```python
import COVID19Py
covid19 = COVID19Py.COVID19()
```

### Choosing a data source

COVID19Py supports the retrieval of data from multiple data sources.
To choose a specific data source, simply pass it as a parameter to the library's constructor:

```python
covid19 = COVID19Py.COVID19(data_source="csbs")
```

For more details about the available data sources, please check the [API's documentation](https://github.com/ExpDev07/coronavirus-tracker-api/blob/master/README.md#picking-data-source).

### Getting latest amount of total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries:

```python
latest = covid19.getLatest()
```

### Getting all locations:

```python
locations = covid19.getLocations()
```

or:

```python
locations = covid19.getLocations(timelines=True)
```

to also get timelines.

You can also rank the results by `confirmed`, `deaths` or `recovered`.

```python
locations = covid19.getLocations(rank_by='recovered')
```

### Getting location by country code:

```python
location = covid19.getLocationByCountryCode("US")
```

or:

```python
location = covid19.getLocationByCountryCode("US", timelines=True)
```

to also get timelines.

### Getting a specific location (includes timelines by default):

```python
location = covid19.getLocationById(39)
```

### Getting location by country name:

```python
location = covid19.getLocationByCountry("Zimbabwe")
```

or:

```python
location = covid19.getLocationByCountry("Zimbabwe", timelines=True)
```

### Getting all data at once:

You can also get all the available data with one command.

```python
data = covid19.getAll()
```

or:

```python
data = covid19.getAll(timelines=True)
```

to also get timelines.

`latest` will be available on `data["latest"]` and `locations` will be available on `data["locations"]`.

### Getting `latest` deltas:

When using `getAll()`, COVID19Py will also store the previous version of the retrieved data. This allows us to easily see how data changed since the last time we requested them.

```python
changes = covid19.getLatestChanges()
```

```json
{
  "confirmed": 512,
  "deaths": 16,
  "recovered": 1024
}
```
